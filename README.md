# LED-Complexity
## By: Lauren Marone

### Software Design
For this assignment, I coded a program that will have the red LED light on my board blink when the user presses the yellow button. The code is simple and consists of a setup and a loop function. The loop function is where the if statement happens that allows the blinking to happen when the user presses on the button. The light will flicker rapidly because I chose to put the delay at 50 milliseconds so the time in between the light being on or off is much shorter. 


### Reflections
Since I missed the first day of this class that dove into working with Arduino and our boards, this assignment was a lot harder than it probably was for the rest of the class. The coding was not complicated as it is very similar to p5 and processing but putting together the board was quite difficult. I still donâ€™t quite understand a lot of what the board means or how it works, but I am hoping that my confusion will go away within the next couple of classes and assignments!
